# COVID-19 analysis

The notebook accompanying the blog post https://exact-byte.com/visualization-of-the-covid-19-coronavirus-croatia-and-worldwide/.

This notebook fetches data from the external repo https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 which it then uses for visualizations.
The nice thing about the repo is that it gets updated and every day (or minute if you are paranoid) you can check out the progress and re-run all the visualizations to see the status.
